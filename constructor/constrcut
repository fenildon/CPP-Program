when object created:
->memory creation as well as memory inalization
->if we don't write any construcotr compiler will provied default constructor
note: if we provied explicitly parameterized constructor and create object with no parameter in this case compiler will not provied default constrcutor it will genrated an error

1)default constructor:
->it is called as non parameter constructor does not accept any parameter
->if we explicitly don't write any constructor it is exicute

2)parameterized constrctor:
->it contain one or more argument

3)copy constrcutor
->used to copy of one class object and initalize it by using another object
->take single argument called refreance to another object
